syntax
function descriptor=open("filename","mode")
func descriptor or file descriptor
eg:
	f=open("name.txt","r")
3 types of mode:
	read(r),write(w),append(a)
append means write balance
write means overwrite

for file in another folder:
	open("give full path","mode")

to view our path:
	type pwd

/->it is a path opener

to create a new file:
	if it doesn't exist also:
		f=open("name.txt","w")
	if there is content,it will overwrite

to close file:
	f.close()

to read:
	f.open("name.txt","r")
	s=f.read()
	print(s)
	f.close()
to append:
	
	f.open("name.txt","a")
	m="hello"
	f.write(m)
	f.close()
		this will write "hello" as balance of previous text
